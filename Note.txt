Upgrade Symfony from >=4.0 version

Resources for upgrading info:

patch upgrade https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/upgrade_patch.html

minor upgrade https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/upgrade_minor.html

major upgrade https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/upgrade_major.html

To quickly sum up the three resources above:



A. Upgrade Symfony app to patch version, e.g. from 4.1.1 to 4.1.8

run composer update command



or



B. Upgrade Symfony app to minor version, e.g. from 4.2 to 4.3 or to major version, e.g. from 4 to 5



1. Update Symfony dependencies in composer.json file, for example if you want to upgrade from Symfony 4.1 to 4.3:

{

    "require": {

...

        "symfony/cache": "^4.0"

...

}



Next in the extra block of the composer.json file make sure you have:

"extra": {

    "symfony": {

        "allow-contrib": false,

        "require": "4.3.*"

    }

}





Another example, if you want to upgrade from Symfony 4.* to 5 stable,released! version:

{

    "require": {

...

        "symfony/cache": "^5.0"

...

}



Next in the extra block of the composer.json file make sure you have:

"extra": {

    "symfony": {

        "allow-contrib": false,

        "require": "5.0.*"

    }

}



2. Next run the following command:  composer update "symfony/*" --with-all-dependencies



3. Next run:  composer update



4. Read the UPGRADE file from https://github.com/symfony/symfony. For example if you want to upgrade from Symfony 4 to 5 read UPGRADE-5.0.md file. See if something needs to be changed in your application.



5. Make your code deprecation free. To do so, open the profiler tool and click Logs section. See what is deprecated and if necessary resolve it.



6. Run tests (if you have them) and see if there are some deprecation. Resolve them if necessary.
